Simple Quiz build with JavaScript, Html and CSS Bootstrap.<br>
The quiz is timed and the player has 60 seconds to answer the 5 questions. Each correct question it's 5 points.
At the end, the user initials  and score are stored in the localStorage. <br>
I made this application displaying and hidding content as the quiz goes. Each questions has a function that is called right after a button it's clicked. <br>
I will come back to fix the scores and the timer because the math behind it it's incorrect. I was not able to target my buttons because in each loop they held a diferrent value.  For practice purposes, I decided to increase the score no mater which choice was clicked.
